# 🤝 How to Contribute to the Symbiotic Factory

We are decentralizing gigaton-scale carbon removal. We need a planetary coalition of hackers, engineers, and scientists. Here is how you can help:

### 📐 [Hardware / CAD Engineers]
* **Current Bounties:** 
  * We need optimized, parametric `.STEP` files for the Venturi nano-bubbler nozzles.
  * We need OpenFOAM CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations to optimize the WATER module's helical cyclonic baffles to maximize fluid shear.
* **Rules:** Prefer open-source CAD (FreeCAD, OpenSCAD, Blender). Always upload neutral formats (`.STEP`, `.IGES`, `.STL`).

### 💻 [Embedded Devs / AI Engineers]
* **Current Bounties:**
  * Refine the C++ PID control loops in `/software_and_ai` for the ESP32 to maintain the strict pH 5.8 / $37^\circ\text{C}$ conditions required by *Clostridium*.
  * We need a Python script to dynamically adjust LED pulse rates based on Optical Density (OD) sensor feedback.
* **Rules:** Comment your code thoroughly. Include wiring diagrams (Fritzing/KiCad).

### 🧬 [Chemists / Bio-Hackers]
* **Current Bounties:**
  * Improve the open-source synthesis protocol for the $Ag/WO_3$ alginate mesh. We need to increase the solar-to-CO conversion efficiency using off-the-shelf, garage-accessible chemicals.
  * Establish a P2P mailing network for sharing high-lipid halotolerant microalgae and extreme gas-fermenting bacterial strains.
* **Rules:** Always include Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and safe disposal protocols for chemical waste.
