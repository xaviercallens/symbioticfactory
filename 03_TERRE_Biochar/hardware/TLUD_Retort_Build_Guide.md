# 🌍 TLUD Double-Barrel Retort Build Guide
**Module III (TERRE) Hardware Instructions v1.0**

This DIY guide details how to build a **Top-Lit Updraft (TLUD) Double-Barrel Retort**. 
This device performs **Anaerobic Slow Pyrolysis ($400-600^\circ\text{C}$)** on the solid organic waste generated by the FIRE module. Because the inner chamber is starved of oxygen, the carbon cannot combust into ash. Instead, volatile compounds are stripped away, fusing the remaining carbon into a highly recalcitrant **Polycyclic Aromatic Carbon (PAC)** lattice. 

If this material is not synthesized correctly (e.g., if you accidentally let oxygen in and just burn the waste), the carbon instantly returns to the atmosphere as $CO_2$. Built correctly, this PAC acts as a permanent, millennial-scale carbon sink when buried in soil, or serves as the critical substrate for the SUN module's evaporator.

## ⚠️ Fire & Temperature Warning
* This retort operates at $600^\circ\text{C}$ ($1100^\circ\text{F}$). The outer steel will glow dull red.
* **DO NOT** operate near structures, dry brush, or over concrete (concrete can spall and explode under extreme heat). Operate securely on dirt or gravel.
* Use heavy leather welding gloves and a face shield when handling the hot drum or performing the final quench.

## 🛠️ Materials & Tools Required

### Materials
1. **One 55-gallon tight-head steel drum:** (This is the "Outer Barn" / Firebox). Must be unlined (no epoxy coating inside).
2. **One 30-gallon open-head steel drum with a locking lid:** (This is the "Inner Retort"). Must fit comfortably inside the 55-gallon drum with an air gap around the sides.
3. High-temperature furnace cement (rated to at least $1000^\circ\text{C}$) OR a MIG/TIG welder.
4. Three steel bricks or thick metal standoffs (to elevate the inner drum).

### Tools
- Angle Grinder with metal-cutting discs
- Power Drill with a step-bit (capable of drilling up to $1/2"$)
- Heavy hammer and cold chisel

## 🏗️ Build Instructions

### Step 1: The Outer Barn (The Heating Jacket)
1. Take the 55-gallon drum and cut the entire top lid off completely using the angle grinder. This is now an open cylinder.
2. Cut a square "fire door" (approx $12" \times 12"$) into the side of the 55-gallon drum, right at the bottom edge. Keep the cut metal square—you will use it as a makeshift door to control airflow.
3. Drill a series of ten $1/2"$ "Secondary Air" holes evenly spaced around the top rim of the 55-gallon drum (about $2"$ down from the top edge). This allows fresh oxygen to mix with the rising syngas, creating a secondary combustion zone that burns extremely hot and smokeless.

### Step 2: The Inner Retort (The Anaerobic Chamber)
1. Take the 30-gallon drum. **Do not cut the sides or top.** The goal is an airtight seal.
2. Flip the 30-gallon drum upside down (so the lid is on the bottom).
3. Using the drill, create a ring of five $1/2"$ holes *only on the bottom* of the drum. 
   - *The Physics:* As the biomass inside bakes, it releases combustible Syngas ($H_2$ + $CO$ + $CH_4$). Because the drum is sealed on top and only vented on the bottom, the syngas is forced downward out of the holes, where it enters the firebox gap, ignites, and provides the heat needed to sustain the endothermic pyrolysis reaction inside.

### Step 3: Assembly & The Burn Protocol
1. Place the three steel standoffs/bricks inside the bottom of the 55-gallon drum.
2. **Pack the Retort:** Fill the 30-gallon drum completely with your dry organic waste (or solid hydrochar from the FIRE module). Pack it tightly.
3. Seal the lid of the 30-gallon drum tightly using its locking ring. 
4. Carefully lower the loaded 30-gallon retort inside the 55-gallon drum, resting it on the standoffs. Ensure it is centered so there is a uniform gap between the inner and outer walls.

### Step 4: Ignition and Pyrolysis
1. Fill the gap between the 55-gallon and 30-gallon drums with waste wood, sticks, and kindling, all the way to the top.
2. Light the fire from the *top* (Top-Lit Updraft). As the fire burns down, it heats the inner retort to $500^\circ\text{C}$.
3. **The Syngas Flare:** After 20-40 minutes, you will hear a jet-engine roaring sound, and thick white smoke will emerge from the secondary air holes at the top of the outer drum. Once this smoke ignites into bright yellow/blue flames, the system is fully self-sustaining. The syngas is baking the biochar for you.

### Step 5: The Quench (CRITICAL)
1. When the syngas flare dies down, the biomass has fully carbonized.
2. **DANGER:** If you open the retort now, the $500^\circ\text{C}$ biochar will hit the oxygen in the air, instantly flash into fire, and burn to white ash. All carbon capture is lost.
3. **You must starve it of oxygen to cool.** 
4. Using heavy gloves, pull the 30-gallon retort out of the outer barn. 
5. IMMEDIATELY flip it upside down and pack wet dirt around the bottom vents to seal them, OR plunge the entire closed retort into a larger tub of water to rapidly cool it below $100^\circ\text{C}$ before opening.

Once cool, open the lid. You should have dense, black, crystalline Polycyclic Aromatic Carbon. You can now use this to build the SUN module, or mix it into agricultural soils to permanently bury the carbon and lock water into the root zones.
