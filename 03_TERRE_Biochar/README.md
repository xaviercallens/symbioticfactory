# 🌍 Module III: TERRE (Millennial-Scale PAC Synthesis)

**Objective:** Thermochemical stabilization of biomass waste into Polycyclic Aromatic Carbon (PAC) for permanent pedological carbon sequestration and evaporator fabrication.

Carbon captured by the algae in the WATER module is naturally labile—if it rots or degrades, the captured $CO_2$ returns directly to the atmosphere within a few years. To achieve permanent CDR, the solid biomass must be structurally locked.

## The Hardware: Architecture 🛠️

By subjecting the organic solid waste from the FIRE module to **Anaerobic Slow Pyrolysis** ($400-600^\circ\text{C}$), we strip away volatile compounds while fusing the remaining carbon atoms into a highly recalcitrant graphene-like matrix (O:C ratio $<0.2$). The decay constant of this material approaches zero, ensuring $>1000$ years of sequestration in the soil.

To achieve this zero-oxygen baking process without utilizing external fossil-fuel energy, we leverage a thermodynamic trick: the outgassing syngas ($H_2$ + $CO$) from the baking biomass is routed back into the firebox to sustain the endothermic reaction. This requires a specific hardware design known as a Double-Barrel Retort.

This step-by-step assembly guide details how to build this pyrolyzer out of commonly scavenged 55-gallon and 30-gallon steel drums. It covers the precise venting requirements needed to sustain the secondary combustion drafts, and vitally, the **critical quenching procedure** needed to prevent the freshly baked carbon from combusting into ash upon opening.
