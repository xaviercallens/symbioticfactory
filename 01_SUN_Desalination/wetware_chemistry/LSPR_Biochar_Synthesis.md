# ☀️ Synthesis of Ag-Doped Plasmonic Biochar
**Module I (SUN) Wetware Protocol v1.0**

This protocol details the synthesis of the Interfacial Solar Steam Generation (ISSG) sponge. By combining the extreme microporosity of TERRE biochar with the photothermal Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) of silver nanoparticles, we bypass the immense energy requirements of Reverse Osmosis. Water is "nanoconfined" in the biochar capillaries, reducing its enthalpy of vaporization by nearly 50%.

## ⚠️ Safety Warning
* **Silver Nitrate ($AgNO_3$)** is a strong oxidizer and is highly corrosive to skin and eyes. It will instantly stain skin black for weeks upon UV exposure. **Nitrile gloves and ANSI Z87.1 safety goggles are mandatory.**
* Always pour chemicals into secondary containment. Use a fume hood or well-ventilated outdoor space.

## 🧫 Materials & Reagents Required

### Chemicals
1. **Raw Biochar (PAC):** Harvested from Module III (TERRE). Must be highly porous.
2. **PVA (Polyvinyl Alcohol) Powder:** ~$99\%$ hydrolyzed, molecular weight ~$89,000-98,000$. Acts as the hydrophilic polymer binder.
3. **Silver Nitrate ($AgNO_3$):** Reagent grade ($>99\%$). This is the plasmonic precursor.
4. **Sodium Citrate Crystalline:** Acts as a mild reducing agent and capping agent to stabilize the nanoparticles.
5. **Deionized (DI) Water:** Do not use tap water; the chlorine will precipitate the Silver Nitrate into useless Silver Chloride ($AgCl$).

### Equipment
- Magnetic stirrer with hot plate
- Coffee grinder or mortar & pestle
- Precision scale ($\pm 0.01\text{g}$)
- Standard glass beakers or sterilized mason jars
- UV Lamp (365nm) or direct, intense midday sunlight
- **Drying Tech:** A lyophilizer (Freeze Dryer) is optimal. *See Step 4 for a DIY Hacker alternative.*

## 🔬 Protocol Steps

### Step 1: Substrate Preparation (Milling)
1. Take $50\text{g}$ of dry PAC biochar from Module III.
2. Mill the biochar using a coffee grinder or mortar until it passes through a 100-mesh ($150\text{ }\mu\text{m}$) sieve. Consistency should be like very fine flour.

### Step 2: The Hydrogel Binder
1. Heat $200\text{mL}$ of DI water to $90^\circ\text{C}$ on the magnetic stirrer.
2. Slowly whisk in $10\text{g}$ of PVA powder. **Do this extremely slowly** to prevent the PVA from clumping.
3. Stir at $300\text{ RPM}$ for 1-2 hours until the solution is completely clear and viscous. Let it cool to room temperature.
4. Fold $20\text{g}$ of the milled biochar into the PVA solution until you achieve a uniform, thick black slurry. 
5. Pour the slurry into shallow molds (e.g., silicone pucks) to a depth of $10\text{-}15\text{mm}$.

### Step 3: Plasmonic Doping ($Ag^+$ to $Ag^0$ Precipitation)
1. **Dark Room Step:** Prepare a $0.05\text{ M}$ Silver Nitrate solution by dissolving $0.85\text{g}$ of $AgNO_3$ in $100\text{mL}$ of DI water. Keep away from bright light.
2. Prepare a separate $0.1\text{ M}$ Sodium Citrate solution ($2.94\text{g}$ in $100\text{mL}$ DI water).
3. Soak the molded biochar/PVA pucks in the $AgNO_3$ solution for 30 minutes in the dark to allow capillary absorption.
4. Transfer the soaked pucks into the Sodium Citrate bath.
5. **The Plasmonic Catalyst:** Immediately expose the bath to a strong UV lamp or direct midday sunlight. You will observe the solution turn slightly yellow/brown as the $Ag^+$ ions are photochemically reduced by the citrate into elemental Ag nanoparticles on the surface of the biochar.
6. Expose for 2 hours. Rinse the pucks gently with DI water.

### Step 4: Curing & Fixing (The Nanoconfinement Lock)
The ultimate goal is to maintain the extreme microscopic porosity of the PVA-Biochar matrix. If you just air-dry the puck, capillary-tension forces will collapse the pores as the water evaporates, destroying its ability to nanoconfine water.

* **Method A (Industrial/Lab):** Freeze the pucks at $-80^\circ\text{C}$, then lyophilize (freeze-dry) under vacuum for 48 hours. The ice sublimates directly to gas, leaving the pore structure intact.
* **Method B (DIY Hacker Alternative):** The Acetone Exchange. 
  1. Submerge the wet puck in a bath of $100\%$ Acetone for 24 hours. The acetone displaces the water. 
  2. Because acetone has a much lower surface tension than water ($\approx 24\text{ mN/m}$ vs $\approx 72\text{ mN/m}$), it will evaporate without collapsing the delicate pore walls. 
  3. Remove and let air dry in a well-ventilated area for 48 hours until all acetone smell is gone.

## ✅ Final Verification
Your Plasmonic Sponge is ready. When placed on top of a beaker of saltwater under direct sunlight, it should float, passively draw up water vertically via capillary action, and begin generating visible steam vastly quicker than the bulk water beside it.
