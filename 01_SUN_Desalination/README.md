# ☀️ Module I: SUN (Desalination & Freshwater Generation)

**Objective:** Battery-free purification of seawater/brine/wastewater to generate ultra-pure $H_2O$ for the Aqua-Reactors using **Plasmonic Interfacial Solar Steam Generation (ISSG)**.

Standard desalination (like Reverse Osmosis) requires massive electrical pumps to overcome osmotic pressure. This module bypasses that energy penalty entirely by utilizing solar thermodynamics and nanotechnology.

## The Hardware: Architecture 🛠️

A synthesized plasmonic sponge requires a properly engineered container to function as a closed-loop desalination still. The housing must float directly on the bulk saltwater, hold the carbon sponge in capillary contact with the surface, and catch the resulting high-speed steam to condense it back into liquid freshwater.

Using this script, you can enter the dimensions of your local water tank, and it will instantly generate the 3D-printable geometry for the floating hull and its internal condensation gutters. 

*Note regarding the Condensation Roof:* OpenSCAD provides a reference template for the angled roof, but true optical clarity is required to maximize sunlight penetration. You should not 3D print the roof; instead, cut a piece of flat Acrylic or Polycarbonate sheeting to the dimensions generated by the script and glue it over the printed base to form the A-frame.

**Recommended Print Materials:**
ASA (Acrylic Styrene Acrylonitrile) or Polycarbonate. This module operates outdoors in intense UV sunlight and $100\%$ humidity. Standard PLA will melt and hydrolyze. PETG is acceptable but will degrade under UV over a few years if not coated.

## The Wetware: Core Synthesis 🧪

The engine of this module isn't a mechanical pump—it's a floating, synthesized sponge. 

By taking highly porous **Polycyclic Aromatic Carbon (PAC)** generated by Module III (TERRE), binding it with a hydrophilic polymer, and chemically doping it with **Silver (Ag) nanoparticles**, we create a material that triggers **Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR)**. 

When placed on top of saltwater:
1. It localizes solar heat strictly at the 2D surface (preventing heat from wasting away into the bulk water below).
2. It physically "nanoconfines" the water molecules inside its microscopic capillaries, mathematically dropping the enthalpy of evaporation from $\approx 2256 \text{ kJ/kg}$ to $\approx 1250 \text{ kJ/kg}$.
