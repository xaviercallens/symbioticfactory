# ☀️ Module I: SUN (Desalination & Freshwater Generation)

**Objective:** Battery-free purification of seawater/brine/wastewater to generate ultra-pure $H_2O$ for the Aqua-Reactors using **Plasmonic Interfacial Solar Steam Generation (ISSG)**.

Standard desalination (like Reverse Osmosis) requires massive electrical pumps to overcome osmotic pressure. This module bypasses that energy penalty entirely by utilizing solar thermodynamics and nanotechnology.

## The Wetware: Core Synthesis 🧪

The engine of this module isn't a mechanical pump—it's a floating, synthesized sponge. 

By taking highly porous **Polycyclic Aromatic Carbon (PAC)** generated by Module III (TERRE), binding it with a hydrophilic polymer, and chemically doping it with **Silver (Ag) nanoparticles**, we create a material that triggers **Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR)**. 

When placed on top of saltwater:
1. It localizes solar heat strictly at the 2D surface (preventing heat from wasting away into the bulk water below).
2. It physically "nanoconfines" the water molecules inside its microscopic capillaries, mathematically dropping the enthalpy of evaporation from $\approx 2256 \text{ kJ/kg}$ to $\approx 1250 \text{ kJ/kg}$.
