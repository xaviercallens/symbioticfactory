# 🔥 Synthesis of Ag/WO₃ Z-Scheme Photocatalyst
**Module IV (FIRE) Wetware Protocol v1.0**

This protocol details the synthesis of the $Ag/WO_3$ composite material used to coat the interior of the $CO_2$ reduction reactor. 
Uncaptured $CO_2$ from the WATER module is fed into this glass reactor. When exposed to sunlight, the Tungsten Trioxide ($WO_3$) lattice absorbs photons and excites electrons. The Silver (Ag) nanoparticles act as highly efficient "electron sinks" (the Z-scheme heterojunction), preventing electron-hole recombination and providing the exact reductive potential required to convert $CO_2$ into Carbon Monoxide (CO).

This CO is the absolute required energetic feedstock for the *Clostridium autoethanogenum* Wood-Ljungdahl fermentation pathway in the next stage.

## ⚠️ LETHAL SAFETY WARNING
1. **Carbon Monoxide (CO) Generation:** This catalyst actively generates CO. Carbon Monoxide is an odorless, colorless, and lethal gas. **DO NOT operate or test this reactor indoors without an active residential CO detector.**
2. **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl):** Used during synthesis. Emits corrosive fumes. Use a fume hood or work outdoors with an organic respirator mask.
3. **Silver Nitrate ($AgNO_3$):** Corrosive and will heavily stain skin upon UV exposure. Nitrile gloves required.

## 🧫 Materials & Reagents Required

### Chemicals
1. **Sodium Tungstate Dihydrate ($Na_2WO_4 \cdot 2H_2O$):** Precursor for the semiconductor lattice. (Readily available online).
2. **Hydrochloric Acid (HCl):** $3$ Molar concentration. Used to precipitate the tungstic acid.
3. **Silver Nitrate ($AgNO_3$):** Reagent grade ($>99\%$). The Z-scheme bridge.
4. **Methanol ($CH_3OH$):** Acts as a sacrificial hole scavenger during the photodeposition step.
5. **Nafion Solution (or dilute PVA):** Used as a binder to paint the catalyst onto the glass.
6. **Deionized (DI) Water.**

### Equipment
- Magnetic stirrer with hot plate
- Precision scale ($\pm 0.01\text{g}$)
- Standard glass beakers
- Centrifuge (or coffee filters and extreme patience for gravity filtration)
- UV Lamp (365nm)
- A large, clear glass reactor (e.g., a $1\text{L}$ wide-mouth mason jar)

## 🔬 Protocol Steps

### Step 1: Precipitation of the $WO_3$ Semiconductor Matrix
1. Dissolve $3.3\text{g}$ of Sodium Tungstate in $100\text{mL}$ of DI water. Stir vigorously on the magnetic stirrer until completely clear.
2. **Fume Hood / Outdoors:** Slowly add $3\text{M}$ HCl drop-by-drop into the stirring solution. You will see a pale yellow precipitate begin to form (this is turning the tungstate into tungstic acid/hydrate).
3. Keep adjusting the pH with HCl until it reaches approximately **pH 1.0**.
4. Heat the stirring beaker to $90^\circ\text{C}$ for 4 hours. The yellow precipitate will deepen in color.
5. Turn off heat. Allow the yellow $WO_3$ powder to settle. 
6. Wash the powder 3 times: Decant the liquid, add fresh DI water, stir, and let settle (or centrifuge at $4000\text{ RPM}$). For the final wash, use Methanol to help it dry faster.
7. Dry the yellow powder in an oven at $80^\circ\text{C}$ overnight.

### Step 2: Z-Scheme Photodeposition of Silver (Ag) Nanoparticles
1. Take $1.0\text{g}$ of your dry yellow $WO_3$ powder and disperse it into $100\text{mL}$ of DI water mixed with $10\text{mL}$ of Methanol. (The Methanol will "eat" the positive holes generated by the UV light, allowing the electrons to be totally dedicated to reducing the silver).
2. Stir vigorously in the dark for 30 minutes to establish an adsorption equilibrium.
3. In the dark, add $0.05\text{g}$ of Silver Nitrate ($AgNO_3$) to the stirring suspension.
4. **The Z-Scheme Creation:** Turn on the UV lamp and irradiate the stirring beaker directly for 1 to 2 hours. The suspension will darken slightly (shifting from pure yellow to a greyish-yellow) as nanoscale Silver precipitates perfectly onto the $WO_3$ crystal facets.
5. Wash, centrifuge/filter, and dry the greyish-yellow $Ag/WO_3$ powder at $80^\circ\text{C}$ overnight.

### Step 3: Reactor Painting (Glass Coating)
1. Mix $0.5\text{g}$ of your synthesized $Ag/WO_3$ powder with $5\text{mL}$ of DI water and $2$ drops of Nafion solution (or a few drops of the PVA hydrogel from the SUN module). Sonicate or stir wildly until it forms a uniform "paint."
2. Take your clean, sterilized glass reactor (mason jar).
3. Using a fine brush or a spin-coating method, paint the *interior walls* of the jar with the catalyst slurry. Leave a "window" clear on one side so you can observe the interior later if needed.
4. Bake the jar in an oven at $100^\circ\text{C}$ for 2 hours to firmly cure the binder and adhere the catalyst to the glass.

## ✅ Final Initialization
Your photoreduction reactor is complete. 
To integrate: Seal the jar with a specialized gas-tight lid. Run a silicone tube from the exhaust of the WATER module into the jar. Run a second tube from the jar into your *Clostridium* bioreactor. When you place the jar in direct sunlight, the Z-scheme heterojunction actively splits the incoming $CO_2$, stripping an Oxygen atom off to yield Carbon Monoxide (CO), feeding your liquid-fuel extremophiles.
