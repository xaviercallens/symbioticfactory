# ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY PROTOCOLS ⚠️

The Symbiotic Factory harnesses extreme physical and chemical reactions. **The authors, maintainers, and contributors accept NO LIABILITY for injury, death, or property damage.** You are entirely responsible for your own safety.

### 1. FIRE Module: Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) Pressure Risks
* **The Danger:** HTL operates at subcritical conditions ($300-350^\circ C$ and $10-25 \text{ MPa}$ / 100-250 bar). Water expands violently. If a vessel fails, it will cause a lethal BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion).
* **The Protocol:** DO NOT use standard PVC, iron, or generic plumbing pipes. Use ONLY certified Grade 316L Stainless Steel or Inconel sample cylinders (e.g., Swagelok/Parker). 
* **Mandatory Hardware:** You MUST install a mechanical Burst Disk and a Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) rated appropriately. NEVER fill the reactor past 60% capacity with wet algae to allow for thermal expansion.

### 2. FIRE Module: Carbon Monoxide (CO) Generation
* **The Danger:** The $Ag/WO_3$ photocatalytic reaction reduces $CO_2$ to Carbon Monoxide (CO). CO is an odorless, colorless, highly toxic gas.
* **The Protocol:** All fermentation hacking must be done outdoors or in a highly ventilated area. You MUST have an active residential CO detector placed directly next to the bioreactor. Check all silicone tubing for leaks using soapy water prior to operation.

### 3. Biological Safety & Wetware
* **The Danger:** Contamination of bacterial cultures (*Clostridium*) or toxic algal blooms.
* **The Protocol:** Sterilize all bioreactors (bidons/jerrycans) with bleach solutions or pressure cookers before use. Use a DIY glove-box for inoculations. Dispose of unwanted biological material by boiling or treating with 10% bleach before pouring down the drain. Do not release engineered or non-native strains into local waterways.
